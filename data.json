In training peaks it calculates much lower training stress values then a same effort on flats based on running threshold values which is very accurate. Same for strava where I can get my heart rate much higher than my marathon pace and calculate GAP is much lower. \n The reason for that might be that my running technique is bad and I jump much more than I should or that the terrain forces you to step in ways that tires the body more. IMO, in all these cases, calculating the weight moved at the hips would be a much more accurate measure of true effort. \n Wind doesn't matter much at trail running speeds, we often walk or go very slow even elites. Maybe a calulation that takes into account GAP and HR (after removing delay) could provide a power or efficiency value.\n ",

If an accelerometer is error free, you can calculate instantaneously the current velocity (in 3D) and distance traveled (again, in 3D) simply by integrating the equations of motion with the known 3D acceleration.  With errors involved, eventually you're going to lose track of both, but it may take longer than a typical run to do so with a good enough accelerometer.  Of course, the ground is there and you're stuck to it, so recalibrating in the vertical isn't a problem.\n So the question is, where are the power losses for a runner?  For a cyclist, they're overwhelmingly due to wind resistance on the flat, and simple mgv (mass times the acceleration of gravity times the vertical speed) plays a role on climbs (and descents).  Other causes are minor compared to air resistance on a flat road.  For a runner, maybe vertical bouncing plays the significant role on the flats?  The question arises because if you're running at a constant speed on a flat road, the acceleration is zero horizontally, and all you have to do is overcome losses to maintain that speed.  (If there are no losses, you don't have to work at all.)  Cycling power meters actually measure the force, and the power is easy to obtain from that.  Here, it's a little more mysterious.  They can estimate the power loss due to wind (more or less, since they can't know the wind speed due to weather all they can do is assume it's all self generated), but maybe it isn't that important.  So possibly its mostly losses due to vertical motions of the center of mass (the energy is lost when feet hit the ground, turning it into heat).

In reality, there are several components to the stride that can be shown.  I think, perhaps, you are conflating the idea of effort with speed.  This is a notion from the outdated concepts of the old coaches, such as Jack Daniels.\n The new coaches came about almost a decade ago and talked of mechanics.  They are ridiculed to this day yet their ideas press on.  Pose, Chi, Evolution methods were doing minimalist footwear before Born to Run came out.  Now, I am seeing some of those mechanics ideas becoming mainstream which is wonderful.  Long ago, the Pose Method forums would go on about the physics and mechanics of running efficiently ad nauseam.  Now the technology is allowing us to analyze what we once speculated.  This is could be a book to these methods of teaching.\n Jack Daniels told people to run a race then train against that race time.  He collected enough data to come up with a heuristic.  I didn\u2019t read any sort detailed running mechanics in his famous book.  Even today, people like Pete McGill say these running methods are fads in his new book.  Running form is self-selected, he states.  I say wonderful and these old fuddy-duddies can stick to their old ways.  That means it will be easier to beat their products :)\n ",

Over the last few years that's expanded to tracking distance, perhaps even stride length, but that's quite different than this.  This is mapping your movement in what is effectively a 3D world.  I'll try and get the OK to show some of the 3D stride mechanics images they sent me capturing what is shown every footstep taken.  Interesting stuff.\n The reason HR isn't always a good proxy is the same reason it's not within cycling: HR is very much subject to a number of factors - most notably fatigue.  Now one can debate the merits of racing and training trying to account for fatigue - but it doesn't change the fundamentals that HR is impacted by fatigue (or sickness, etc...).  For example, oftentimes after a redeye flight if I go and do a long run immediately I'll have astounding pace to HR ratios - with my HR typically 5-7bpm lower than normal for that pace/terrain.  The same is often true when an athlete is exhausted.\n Now - there's plenty of valid debate to happen down the road in terms of how power can be applied in running.  Whether or not it's accurate in X, Y, and Z conditions.  Or against A, B, and C people.  But, it's seemingly silly (or premature) to write off a technology simply because one doesn't understand it.  If that was the case, then we wouldn't have a lot of technologies we see today in sports technology.\n ",

A road bike in decent condition has an efficiency of some 98 or 99%. \n This is not as simple when running. Efficiency (how many percent of the watts you push into your feet do actually push you forward?) can be very different depending on technique and other factors. When running in place, effiencency is actually zero. What does the unit show in that situation? Does it show the 250W that make you tired or does it show zero because you are not going anywhere? \n Of yourse we are not running in place during a race, but I don't think running efficency should be assumed to be constant.

No, it wouldn't.  On a bicycle, you crest a hill, and (assuming a hill worthy of the name) your power would drop to zero immediately after cresting and beginning the descent.  In no way would it follow the contour of the terrain.  Runners aren't cyclists, and you have to keep your feet moving underneath you and control your descent, but I'd bet money the same thing should happen, the power output should immediately drop to low levels as you headed downward and gravity (rather than you) provides the energy needed to overcome whatever is resisting you.\n Incidentally, the fact that power goes up while climbing is a psychological  reaction, not a physical necessity.  Physics says that you need a certain amount of energy to raise your body vertically a given distance, but doesn't say how fast you have to generate it (power).  If you maintain a constant power, you'd still make it to the top, just slower (on a bike you'd have to stay upright, though).  We work harder on climbs because we want to get it over with and we don't want to go that slow, not because we need to.\n ",
